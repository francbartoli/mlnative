# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.4.0.dev1] - 2026-09-28

### Added

- Protocol 2.1: a render command can resize the map (`width`, `height`) and answer raw RGBA (`output: "rgba"`).
- `AsyncRenderer` and `RawImage`: an asyncio interface to the renderer process.
- `fit_bounds()` as a module function, also used by `Map.fit_bounds` and `AsyncRenderer.fit_bounds`.

### Fixed

- `fit_bounds` centres on the Web Mercator midpoint, counts MapLibre's 512-pixel world and gives the same camera at any pixel ratio.
- A renderer process killed on cancellation is reaped on the loop, so its pipes are closed before the loop is.

### Changed

- Wheels are tagged `manylinux_2_39`, the glibc of the Ubuntu 24.04 runners that build them; the runners are pinned.
- Releases go to this fork's GitHub releases only.

## [0.3.13] - 2026-06-09

### Added

- Added `python -m mlnative doctor` / `mlnative doctor` diagnostics for platform, binary, timeout, and optional renderer smoke checks.
- Exported public type aliases for `Center`, `Bounds`, and `RenderView`.

### Changed

- `Map` now accepts an optional per-instance `timeout` and accepts tuple/list coordinate and bounds inputs.
- Modernized FastAPI examples to use `typing.Annotated` request validation.
- Refreshed development dependency floors and expanded Ruff maintainability rules.

### Fixed

- Committed `uv.lock` for frozen CI security scans.
- Installed GLSL/SPIR-V build dependencies in CI.
- Switched release wheel jobs to the same host binary build path verified by CI.

## [0.3.10] - 2026-06-09

### Fixed

- Stopped renderer daemons after command timeouts to prevent stale responses from being consumed by later calls.
- Rewound the reused Rust temporary style file before JSON style rewrites.
- Improved Rust renderer error responses with actionable context.
- Refreshed the pinned release provenance action digest.

### Changed

- Updated Rust dependencies, including `maplibre_native` 0.8.2, and moved the renderer to the `CameraUpdate` API.
- Replaced release wheel filename rewriting with a `cibuildwheel` build and repair flow.
- Moved developer guidance from `AGENTS.md` into `CONTRIBUTING.md` and removed `AGENTS.md`.
- Extracted shared render/style validation helpers in `Map` to reduce duplicated input handling.
- Tightened GeoJSON helper validation for coordinate ranges and common wrong input shapes.
- Updated example servers to use a style allowlist instead of arbitrary request-provided URLs or paths.
- Made the production pool example use bounded waits and a cheap readiness health check.
- Added troubleshooting and public server safety guidance to docs.

## [0.3.9] - 2025-02-15

### Fixed

- Removed unreachable Path handling code in `map.py` `_get_daemon()` and `load_style()`
- Moved `import base64` to module level in `_bridge.py` (was inside methods)
- Fixed potential panics in Rust daemon by replacing `.expect()` with proper error handling
- Removed duplicated style loading logic in Rust (extracted to `load_style()` helper)
- Fixed outdated error message in `preview.html` (now references `just build-rust`)

### Added

- Added `tests/conftest.py` with shared pytest fixtures
- Added `tests/test_bridge.py` for `_bridge.py` unit tests
- Added `tests/test_geo_bounds.py` for `bounds_to_polygon()` tests
- Added `docs/API.md` with comprehensive API reference
- Added visual regression testing with `just visual-render` and `just visual-compare`
- Added `scripts/visual_compare.py` for comparing mlnative vs Chrome renders
- Added `playwright` to dev dependencies for visual testing
- Added example scripts: `error_handling.py`, `geojson_layers.py`, `production_deployment.py`

### Changed

- Improved CI workflow with separate lint/test/build stages
- Added Rust clippy checks to CI
- Added code coverage reporting

## [0.3.8] - 2025-01-XX

### Added

- Initial public release
- `Map` class for static map rendering
- `render()` and `render_batch()` methods
- `fit_bounds()` for automatic zoom calculation
- `set_geojson()` for dynamic GeoJSON updates
- `load_style()` for URL, file path, or dict styles
- GeoJSON helper utilities in `mlnative.geo`
- FastAPI example server
- Web test interface
